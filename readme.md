1.1.  Task.
As a web user, I wish to find out my age accurate to number of hours so that I can impress my friends.

Acceptance Criteria:

- A name can be entered.

- My date of birth can be entered using a date picker.

- User age in years days and hours is displayed.

- Name and age of previous submissions is displayed.


1.2.  Deliverables.  You should produce:

- All code files required to fulfil the acceptance criteria.
 
This is typically a PHP technical exercise, but it is not limited to just using PHP.

The work will be measured first and foremost as a technical exercise and how well your work meets the acceptance criteria. Bonus points for good code.

There is no time limit. We simply want you to send us back all of the files required once you are satisfied that you’ve met the acceptance criteria.

Once you have returned the technical exercise to us, we will review the submission and provide feedback during the face-to-face interview.

You can pick how much or little time you spend and on the approach, you take – there is no wrong answer.
